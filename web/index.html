            The main goal of this project was to create an intuitive interface
            for granular synthesis. This synthesis technique is fundamentally
            about manipulating and processing tiny pieces of sound to create new
            textures and timbres. Curtis Roads, a key figure in the development
            of granular synthesis, offers a concise definition of this technique
            in his 1988 paper "An Introduction to Granular Synthesis." He
            states, "Granular synthesis involves generating thousands of very
            short sonic grains to form larger acoustic events." This definition
            encapsulates the essence of granular synthesis, where many tiny,
            brief sound elements-grains-are produced and combined.

            The keyboard, which is commonly used to interface with granular
            synthesis, does not complement the technique and provides limited
            control. This is mainly due to the large number of parameters
            available and the limited reliance on pitch. Therefore, interfaces
            that offer multi-dimensional control allow for a more nuanced and
            dynamic manipulation of the complex parameters involved in granular
            synthesis. With this in mind, a_bowl_of_grain aims to provide a
            tactile multidimensional connection to the grains of sound created
            by granular synthesis. Digital musical instruments (DMI) such as the
            GrainPlain, MetaMuse, PebbleBox and CrumbleBag tackle this idea.
            Each of them provides a slightly different take on this tactile
            connection.

        <h2>DESIGN PROCESS, TECHNICAL AND CREATIVE DETAILS</h2>
        <p>Summary of this section</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        My initial ideas centred around detecting when an object created
        vibration on the surface of a resonant material and then using these
        vibrations to trigger grains of sound. Also, I wanted to provide
        multi-dimensional control of the grain via localising the vibration on
        the surface. This idea was inspired by the GrainPlain, which maps
        vibrations x y(cartesian) location on a flat metal surface to granular
        synthesiser parameters.

        <br />
        <br />

        A metal bowl with attached contact mics was decided upon as an
        appropriate system for detecting vibrations. As well as vibrations
        travelling well through the metal surface, the bowl shape provides
        control over the objects, allowing them to be ‘tossed around’ in a more
        rhythmic and musical way without the player touching the surface.
        Additionally, the bowl is a well-known vessel for objects, so it is
        intuitive as to how the grains can be manipulated. This idea is inspired
        by Perry Cook's principle, “Household objects make amusing controllers”,
        from the 2001 paper Principles for Designing Computer Music Controllers.
        Also, since the bowl will be tilted and shaken to move the objects
        around, it seemed appropriate to use an accelerometer to add extra
        control dimensions.

        <br />
        <br />

        The system is comprised of four parts.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Sensors
        <br />
        Four contact mics and an accelerometer were wired together and attached
        to the bottom of the bowl.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Arduino
        <br />
        The Arduino Values from the sensors are read into the Arduino via the
        analogue pins. The contact mic closest to a vibration is found. The data
        from the accelerometer is processed by the

        >
        library. The amplitude level, microphone index and accelerometer x, y
        values are then output to the serial bus.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Granular synthesiser
        <br />
        A Max patch running a granular synthesiser implemented with the
        grainflow package is then used to read values from the serial port. A
        vibration detected from the contact mic triggers the granular synth to
        create a grain. The amplitude of the vibration controls the loudness of
        the grain. The x value from the accelerometer controls at what point a
        grain should be created in the original sample source. This allows
        exploration of the original sample via tilting the bowl left or right.
        The y value from the accelerometer allows a lowpass filter, applied to
        the grains, to be opened or closed by tilting the bowl forward or back.
        <br />
        <br />
        Spatalisation
        <br />
        In my instrument performance, a 24-channel ambisonics setup was used to
        spatialise the grains. Throughout the piece, 4 speakers were constantly
        playing grains. Depending on which contact mic was closest to the
        vibration, another 5 speakers played grains. The 5 speakers were grouped
        into front right, front left, back right, and back left. This was
        implemented in Max using the MC library.
